Despite their youth, many of these individuals have rapidly built their fortunes through successful startups, viral online businesses, or early investments in emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. While they represent a small portion of the total billionaire wealth, their potential for future growth is immense. The under-20 billionaires are early adopters of digital technologies and demonstrate the growing role of youth in wealth creation.",

Many in this age group built their fortune from innovative startups, cryptocurrency, or software platforms. Although their combined net worth is significantly lower than older groups, the pace at which some members accumulated wealth is noteworthy. This group reflects the growing impact of digital innovation on wealth creation.",
    "31‚Äì40": "‚úÖ **31-40 Age Group**\nBillionaires aged 31‚Äì40 begin to show more influence on the overall wealth landscape. With more experience and maturing businesses, many of them scaled startups into global enterprises. Technology remains the dominant sector here, with a few notable figures making up large portions of this group's net worth. While still behind older groups in total wealth, they show strong upward momentum.",
    "41‚Äì50": "‚úÖ **41-50 Age Group**\nThis age group marks a transition toward wealth consolidation. Many individuals here are seasoned entrepreneurs or executives in both tech and traditional industries. Compared to younger age brackets, the total net worth sees a noticeable increase, as businesses founded earlier now yield substantial returns. The wealth gap between this group and those in their 30s highlights how time significantly contributes to financial growth.",
    "51‚Äì60": "‚úÖ **51-60 Age Group**\nWith decades of experience, billionaires in their 50s often have diversified portfolios and stable positions in established industries. This group begins to approach the peak in terms of wealth accumulation. Many are long-time business owners or key shareholders in multinational firms. Their wealth reflects a combination of strategic investments, legacy holdings, and accumulated growth over time.",
    "61+": "‚úÖ **61+ Age Group**\nThis group holds the largest share of total billionaire wealth, reflecting a lifetime of business development, inheritance, and investment gains. Many members are founders or heirs of long-standing companies, and their wealth is often diversified globally. Their financial influence shapes industries and markets across the world."
